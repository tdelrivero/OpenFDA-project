# OpenFDA-project

The Open FDA API allows users to search through various databases containing information about drugs and biologics that have been subjected to FDA review.
The Drugs@FDA database that is part of the Open FDA API includes most of the drug products approved since 1939. The majority of patient information, labels, approval letters, reviews, and other information are available for drug products approved since 1998. Drugs@FDA contains information about prescription brand-name drug products, generic drug products, and many therapeutic biological products.

The goal of this project is to gather data from OpenFDA API to evaluate specific groups of FDA approved drugs and biologics (such as NSAIDs)
